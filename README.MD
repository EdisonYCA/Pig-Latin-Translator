# Pig Latin Translator
The goal of pig latin is to translate English words into a peculiar semi-comprehensible altercation.
Words that begin with a vowel get "ay" appended to the end of it, so "Awesome" becomes "Awesomeay." 
Words beginning with a vowel and a consonant get the initial consonant moved to the end of the word, and get "ay" appended to it. So "Hello" becomes "elloHay."
If a word begins with two or more consonants, all letters are moved to the end of the word until the last letter is reached, or a vowel is reached in the word. Then, "ay"
is appended to the end of the word. So, "Myth" becomes "hMytay" and "Optimistic" becomes "imisticOptay."

# How it works
The program uses **JOptionPane** class to prompt the user for an English word or sentence. It then uses the **JOptionPane** to display the translation.
